# Text Mining Analytic

#Aim

It is process of identifying pattens & extracting useful insights from unstructural text data. By using NLTK.

#Objective

It is process of examining large collection of documents to discover new infromation or help ansswer specific research questions. fiesf mining identifies facts, realationships and assertions that would otherwise remain buried in the mass of textual big data.

#Methodology

Text Mining Analysis is a machine learning technique used to automatically extract valuable insights from unstructured text data. Companies use text analysis tools to quickly digest online data and documents, and transform them into actionable insights.

#Data Collection
Collecting Data in Text Format from www.google.com On That Data performed Various In Natural Language Toolkit the Operation is Tokenization, Frequency Distribution, Stop words , Removing Words, Stemming ,Lemmatization ,POS Tagging, Bag of Words etc.

#Tools and Technology Used

Python and Natural Language Toolkit or Natural Language Processeing.

Jupyter Notebook

Python Libraries: nltk, Matplotlib, word_tokenize, sent_tokenize, Stopwords, PorterStemmer, WordNetLemmatizer , CountVectorizer

#Text Mining Techniques

Information Extraction. This is the most famous text mining technique.

Information Retrieval.

Categorization.

Clustering.

Summarisation.

Risk Management.

Customer Care Service.

Fraud Detection.

#Conclusion

A comparison of different text mining techniques has been shown which can be further enhanced. Text mining algorithms will give us useful and structured data which can reduces time and cost. Hidden information in social network sites, bioinformatics and internet security etc. are identified using text mining is a major challenge in these fields.
